https://github.com/C4Framework/C4iOS
C4 is an open-source creative coding framework that harnesses the power of native iOS programming with a simplified API that gets you working with media right away. Build artworks, design interfaces and explore new possibilities working with media and interaction.
##Install Carthage
After cloning or downloading this repo you will need to install carthage. Follow the instructions on their github page to install.
https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

##Get the framework into your local projects.
After carthage is installed you will need to run 'carthage bootsrap' from the top level of each project directory. 
That's it! Now you can access the C4 api from each project.
(MosaicLayout uses cocaopods, run pod install from the top directory of that project)
##Run them, make them better
Run the projects, and see how C4 is utilized for animations, visuals, audio, movies and thread control.
